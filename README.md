# Traffic simulator

## What is this?

This is my project submission for my C university class.
It is a program that can run simple traffic simulations written using the C programming language.

## Running:

Run shell script compileSim. This will create an executable called runSimulations.

Enter the command ./runSimulations to run the program.
